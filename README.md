### Running the Program

Main class: Breakout

Data files needed: ball.gif, brick1.gif, brick2.gif, brick3.gif, brick4.gif, paddle.gif, red_heart.jpg (https://www.kisspng.com/png-heart-red-valentines-day-font-dark-red-heart-png-c-121777/), pong_beep.wav

Key/Mouse inputs:
Left -> Paddle moves to the left.
Right -> Paddle moves to the right.
P -> Pause and resume the game.
Escape -> Close the stage and thus the game because the application has only one stage.
Click mouse -> Pause and resume the game.

Cheat keys:

Known Bugs:
When the ball bounces close to the corner of a brick, my algorithm may not correctly determine whether the ball bounces with the top/bottom edges or the left/right edges.
